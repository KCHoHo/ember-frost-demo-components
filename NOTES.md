`ember-prism` in this add-on should be listed as a dependency (it is currently a devDependency) but in version 0.0.8 it is not traversing the tree to correctly find the [bower directory](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-prism/blob/be4919912fee4895964db101296bc523ca2c8093/index.js#L40) when consumed in an add-on so the build will fail when it looks for `undefined/prism/prism.js`
